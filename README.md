# custom-easyOCR
This project focuses on training a custom EasyOCR model to detect and recognize numbers within Clash of Clans (CoC) images. The model is specifically fine-tuned to recognize various numbers that appear in CoC images, such as those associated with gold, trophies, and other in-game statistics.
